What are your opinions on Agile software development?
Agile is a software-development-centric process and the methodology minimizes the need and costs associated with project management, people management and tracking. Two unique contributions of Agile are iterative development and open communication. Two shortfalls of Agile - developer burnout, high levels of stress and risk of overengineering and business failure. 


TDD or BDD?
Test Driven development definitely. Test driven development pulls a software system towards business goals.

TDD is process that bridges business goals with technology limitations better than BDD and DDD.
