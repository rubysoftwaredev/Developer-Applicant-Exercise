On a windows-based PC I usually install cygwin with a bash shell and with vi.

On windows I use Word 2007 and Paint

I do not like software and processes running on windows that simply take up CPU time.

I like using Eclipse IDE but only if required. At present I use vi on cygwin to develop ruby code and tests.
